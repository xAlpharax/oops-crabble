# oops-crabble
Scrabble Game for my C++ OOP class. GUI made with SFML.

### OOPS = OOP Sucks
( But Scrabble almost doesn't ! )

## Instructions

First, download a word list for your language. I was able to get one for Romanian from [dexonline](https://dexonline.ro/scrabble), specifically the 6.0 reduced form `.txt` file after extraction. Rename this file to `word-list-ro.txt` and you should be set.

Since the font `Inconsolata-Regular.ttf` comes with the repository, there are no other outside resources / assets needed.

To run the game, simply follow standard C++ building and running procedure:

```bash
# While in the project directory, run make to compile the game.
make

# Same conditions, to run the game.
./scrabble
```

If you press `Tab` you'll see a (maximum) top 20 list of valid words you can form out of the given letters.
